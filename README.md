# Music Recommendation System

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Music Recommendation System using the Million Song Dataset. The system predicts user preferences and recommends songs based on various machine-learning techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization.

## Dataset

- **Million Song Dataset**: A collection of metadata and audio features for a million contemporary popular music tracks. It provides the basis for building and evaluating the recommendation system.

## Project Features

1. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends songs based on the preferences of similar users. This technique assumes that if user A has a similar listening history to user B, then songs that B has enjoyed are likely to be enjoyed by A.
   - **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends songs based on the similarity between songs. If a user likes a particular song, the system will recommend other songs that share similar characteristics.

2. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - This technique leverages the metadata of songs (e.g., genre, artist, tempo, etc.) to recommend songs. It focuses on matching song features with user preferences, making it effective for recommending less popular or new songs without much user feedback.

3. **Matrix Factorization**
   - **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: A powerful technique to uncover latent features in the dataset, which represent both users' preferences and the attributes of the songs. SVD helps in making personalized recommendations by predicting the interaction between users and songs.

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Cold Start Problem**
   - Implemented strategies to handle scenarios where new users or new songs have little to no historical data. Techniques such as using content-based filtering help mitigate the cold start issue.

2. **Data Sparsity**
   - With the large and sparse Million Song Dataset, matrix factorization techniques like SVD are employed to effectively deal with missing data and improve recommendation accuracy.

3. **Scalability**
   - The system is designed to handle the large-scale nature of the Million Song Dataset, making it scalable for use in real-world applications with millions of users and songs.

## Techniques Applied

1. **Nearest Neighbor Methods**
   - Applied to both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering for calculating similarities and making recommendations.

2. **Matrix Factorization**
   - Employed SVD to uncover latent features in the user-item interaction matrix.

## Evaluation

- The system was evaluated using standard metrics for recommender systems, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for rating predictions. Top-N recommendation accuracy was also assessed.
